# **AI-Powered Ethical Decision Making Simulations**

![Project Logo/Banner](frontend/static/images/logo.png) <!-- Add a logo or banner if available -->

This project is a **hackathon submission** developed by a team of 5 members. It is an AI-powered simulation platform designed to help users practice ethical decision-making in various scenarios. The platform uses **Mistral AI** to provide feedback on user choices, making it an interactive and educational tool.

## **Introduction**
In today's world, ethical decision-making is crucial in both personal and professional contexts. This project aims to provide a platform where users can simulate real-life ethical dilemmas, make decisions, and receive AI-generated feedback on their choices. The platform is designed to be intuitive, interactive, and educational.

---

## **Features**
- **Interactive Scenarios**: Users are presented with 10 random ethical dilemmas, each with two choices.
- **AI-Powered Feedback**: After completing the scenarios, users receive feedback generated by **Mistral AI**.
- **Dynamic Question Pool**: Questions are randomly selected from a pool of 30-40 scenarios stored in a JSON file.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for a seamless and responsive user experience.
- **Scalable Backend**: The backend is powered by **Flask**, making it easy to extend and maintain.

---

## **Tech Stack**
- **Frontend**: Streamlit
- **Backend**: Flask
- **AI Integration**: Mistral AI
- **Data Storage**: JSON (for questions and responses)
- **Languages**: Python
- **Version Control**: Git

---

## **Setup Instructions**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Python 3.11** or later.
2. **Mistral API Key**: Obtain it from [Mistral AI](https://www.mistral.ai/).
3. **Git**: For cloning the repository.

### **Installation**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit flask requests python-dotenv
   ```
3. Set up the environment variable for the Mistral API key:
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - **Linux/Mac**:
     ```bash
     export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
***Here we used Gemini ai in main.py  , to use mistral : main.py should be :-***
   ```bash
   import os
import requests

# Mistral API key (set as environment variable or hardcoded)
MISTRAL_API_KEY = os.getenv("MISTRAL_API_KEY", "your_actual_mistral_api_key_here")
MISTRAL_API_URL = "https://api.mixtral.ai/v1/generate"  # Hypothetical URL; check official docs for exact endpoint

# Function to get feedback from Mistral
def get_mistral_feedback(prompt):
    headers = {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {MISTRAL_API_KEY}"  # Mistral typically uses Bearer token auth
    }
    data = {
        "prompt": prompt,  # Mistral's API likely expects a "prompt" field
        "max_tokens": 50,  # Adjust based on Mistral's parameter names and defaults
        "temperature": 0.7  # Optional: control creativity, adjust as needed
    }
    response = requests.post(MISTRAL_API_URL, headers=headers, json=data)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        # Adjust based on Mistral's actual response structure
        return response.json()["choices"][0]["text"]  # Hypothetical; check Mistral docs
    else:
        print(f"Error: Status Code {response.status_code}")
        print(f"Response: {response.text}")
        return "Failed to get feedback from Mistral."


   ```
To run with gemini : With same main.py in repository, Just write your gemini api key at "your_api_key_here" below :  (to use mistral chnage main.py and write mistral-api-key in below command)
   - **Windows**:
     ```bash
     set MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - **Linux/Mac**:
     ```bash
     export MISTRAL_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
     
### **Running the Project**
1. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python main.py
   ```
   The backend will run at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2. Start the frontend (Streamlit app):
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   The frontend will run at `http://localhost:8501`.

3. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501` to use the application.

## **How It Works**
1. **Fetch Questions**:
   - The frontend sends a request to the backend to fetch 10 random questions from the `questions.json` file.
2. **Display Scenarios**:
   - Each question is displayed with two images and corresponding descriptions.
   - The user selects one of the options by clicking on the image.
3. **Submit Responses**:
   - After answering all 10 questions, the user clicks **Submit**.
   - The responses are sent to the backend.
4. **Generate Feedback**:
   - The backend constructs a prompt using the user's responses and sends it to Mistral AI.
   - Mistral AI generates feedback, which is displayed to the user.
5. **Retake or New Test**:
   - The user can retake the same set of questions or start a new test with a different set of questions.
